A first step when analyzing a time series is to visualize the data with a plot. You should be able to clearly see a gradual decrease in searches for \"diet\" throughout the calendar year, hitting a low around the December holidays, followed by a spike in searches around the new year as people make New Year's resolutions to lose weight.\n",

A more mathematical way to describe mean reversion is to say that stock returns are negatively autocorrelated.\n",
