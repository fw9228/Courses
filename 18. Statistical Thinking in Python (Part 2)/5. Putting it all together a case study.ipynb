    "For your first foray into the Darwin finch data, you will study how the beak depth (the distance, top to bottom, of a closed beak) of the finch species Geospiza scandens has changed over time. The Grants have noticed some changes of beak geometry depending on the types of seeds available on the island, and they also noticed that there was some interbreeding with another major species on Daphne Major, Geospiza fortis. These effects can lead to changes in the species over time.\n",

    "# Measuring heritability\n",
    "Remember that the Pearson correlation coefficient is the ratio of the covariance to the geometric mean of the variances of the two data sets. This is a measure of the correlation between parents and offspring, but might not be the best estimate of heritability. If we stop and think, it makes more sense to define heritability as the ratio of the covariance between parent and offspring to the variance of the parents alone. In this exercise, you will estimate the heritability and perform a pairs bootstrap calculation to get the 95% confidence interval.\n",

You need to think carefully about the questions you are seeking to answer with your data and analyze them appropriately.
